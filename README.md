1. Ensuring Functional and Secure Code:
   - To make sure your code is both functional and secure, rigorous testing is key. Set aside personal pride during testing and focus on proving or disproving whether the code does what it's supposed to without unintended consequences. Independent testing teams are beneficial, and integrating tests into Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines ensures they're a seamless part of development. If tests fail, it's essential to investigate and fix the issues instead of turning off the tests.

2. Understanding and Incorporating User Needs:
   - Deciphering user needs can be tricky. Techniques like the 5 Whys during elicitation help, and observing users through methods like shoulder surfing provides valuable insights. Creating mock-ups for end users is a helpful step to avoid major errors in the final software by allowing users to visualize and express their requirements effectively.

3. Approaching Software Design:
   - When designing software, approach the person presenting it with a curious mindset. This is vital for helping them explain their vision, especially when they might not know everything upfront. Elicitation, the process of digging deeper into the client's vision, is the most crucial step in gathering requirements.
